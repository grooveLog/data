# Question

There are the following types of posts which will contribute to a Feed - a scrollable list of recent user activity:

* Groove Completion/non-completion
* Recording Moods
* Task Completion
* Journalling Posts

* There is also the ability to post an update without a Groove/Mood/Task/Journalling (Although we need to decide if this is a worthwhile featue because we don't want this to turn into another noisy social media platform, it should be focused on...)

Feeds will also include user activity such as:
* New vision creation/adoption or update
* New goal creation/adoption or update
* New groove creation/adoption or update
* Taking a quesionnaire

Feeds may also include 'LIKE' activity
* Clicking the Groovy butonn on a feed item or a meditation for example

### How will the Feeds be consumed in the UI?
* Provide a scrollable list of user activity for a single user
* Provide a scrollable list of user activity for a group of users (e.g. everyone you are following/supporting)
* Provide a scrollable list of user activities (single or group) filtered by categorey (e.g. Grooves/Moods/Tasks/Journalling)

## Questions:
The proposal on https://github.com/grooveLog/data creates a number of different tables according to activity type with the idea that these can be joined in queries according to user requests.

* Is this the most efficient way to manage feeds or will we run into problems at scale?
* Would it be better to have one big 'Feeds' table instead
* Or keep the individual tables AND have a separate big Feeds table
* What should be done about archiving?
